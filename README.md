# ReadME-Generator

## Lessons
* This project involved Node.js and the inquierer npm packge.
* Using the skeleton files given, I had to construct a prompt to gather user input.
* Once these user inputs were recieved, then I used the response to generate a custom readMe based on those inputs.
* I had to incorporate proper syntax for .md files when creating the base readMe skeleton.
